# forms-cheatsheet
1st Challenge Project in Codecademy's web development track. <strong>Assignment</strong>: build a reference sheet for a certain aspect of HTML or CSS.

I chose to create a cheatsheet for the &lt;input&gt; element. It was my first time creating a webpage from scratch since I was a child.

Some things I learned from this project:

<ul>
  <li>The difference between margin and padding</li>
  <li>To always supply back-up fonts to font-family</li>
  <li>The existence of the <em>min-width</em> and <em>role</em> attributes</li>
  <li>How to create a horizontal nav-bar</li>
  <li>Improved my understanding of selector specificity</li>
</ul>
