# forms-cheatsheet
This is a cheatsheet for understanding the &lt;input&gt; element in HTML: its most important attributes and some alternative/complementary elements.

I created it in response to the 1st hands-off project in Codecademy's web development track. It was my first time creating a webpage from scratch (at least, as an adult; I first learned HTML as a kid and made websites about everything back then).

Assignment: build a reference sheet for a certain aspect of HTML or CSS.
