# forms-cheatsheet
1st hands-off project in Codecademy's web development track. Assignment: build a reference sheet for a certain aspect of HTML or CSS.

I chose to create a cheatsheet for the &lt;input&gt; element. It was my first time creating a webpage from scratch since I was a child.

Some things I learned from this project:

<ul>
  <li>The difference between margin and padding</li>
  <li>To always supply back-up fonts to font-family</li>
  <li>The existence of the min-width attribute</li>
  <li>The <em>role</em> attribute</li>
